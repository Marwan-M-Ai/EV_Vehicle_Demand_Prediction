🚗 EV Vehicle Demand Prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my first internship (15 July – 16 August 2025) with Edunet Foundation (Skills4Future) in collaboration with Shell and AICTE. The focus was to combine Artificial Intelligence 🤖, Data Analytics 📊, and Green Skills 🌱 to support sustainability goals.

The main objective of this project is to forecast the demand for Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the coming years using real-world data from Washington DC counties. The dataset includes both EV and Non-EV vehicle registrations, enabling a comparative analysis of adoption trends.
